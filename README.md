[![Built with Starlight](https://astro.badg.es/v2/built-with-starlight/tiny.svg)](https://starlight.astro.build)

```
npm create astro@latest -- --template starlight
```

## Spell-checking

This project uses [cspell](https://cspell.org/) to keep typos at bay. You can run cspell by running
the tests:

```
npm test
```

These also run in GitHub Actions, so PRs will fail if they include new typos. If you have
introduced a new valid word that is not in the cspell dictionary and should be accepted
project-wide, add it to the list in `./project-words.txt`. If you have added a new jargon
word to a document and want to make a one-off exception, add a `cspell:ignore` comment
in that document's frontmatter, like this:

```
---
title: Your first cron val
description: Make your first cron val - a weather notifier
lastUpdated: 2024-05-09
# cspell:ignore crongpt
---
```

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro + Starlight project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ content/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ docs/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ config.ts
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ env.d.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ astro.config.mjs
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json
```

Starlight looks for `.md` or `.mdx` files in the `src/content/docs/` directory. Each file is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Images can be added to `src/assets/` and embedded in Markdown with a relative link.

Static assets, like favicons, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
