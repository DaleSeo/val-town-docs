**The Web API lets you expose Vals to the internet, where they can receive
requests and return responses.** It’s built on the web-standard
[Request](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request) and
[Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response) objects,
so it’s compatible with a number of web frameworks like
[Hono](https://hono.dev/) and [Peko](https://github.com/sejori/peko).

We recommend you use the Web API for vals that produce APIs and web pages.

The maximum size for requests at the time of this writing is 2mb.
