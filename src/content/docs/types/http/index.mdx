HTTP Vals let you expose an API or website from your val.

They are built on the web-standard
[Request](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request) and
[Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response) objects,
so are compatible with a number of web frameworks like
[Hono](https://hono.dev/) and [Peko](https://github.com/sejori/peko).

These handlers need to export a function that takes a `Request` object
as the first parameter and returns a `Response` object. The function
can be asynchronous.

```ts title="Example" val
export function handler(request: Request) {
  return Response.json({ ok: true });
}
```

<LinkCard title="Rendering HTML & JSX" href="/types/http/jsx" />

## Limitations

The maximum size for requests is 2mb and the maximum size for responses is 250kb.
