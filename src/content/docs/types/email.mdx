Email handler vals get their own email address that you can send email
to, and when Val Town receives that email, it triggers the val with the email
as its first argument. Ever wanted a robot that you could forward emails to,
or to be able to control something via an email trigger? With email
handler vals it's simple: they get their own, unique address.

## Type Signature

Email handlers receive an argument called `Email` and can do anything with it:
they can go on to reply to the email with the [standard library](/std/email),
or call methods in response to it.

```ts val
export function emailHandler(email: Email) {
  console.log("Email received!");
}
```

The `Email` type has this shape:

```ts
interface Email {
  from: string;
  to: string[];
  subject: string | undefined;
  text: string | undefined;
  html: string | undefined;
}
```

## Example

```ts title="@user/testEmail" val
import { blob } from "https://esm.town/v/std/blob";
import { email } from "https://esm.town/v/std/email";

export async function testEmail2(e: {
  from: string;
  to: string[];
  subject: string;
  text: string;
  html: string;
}) {
  const testEmails = await blob.getJSON("testEmails") as [];
  await blob.setJSON("testEmails", [...testEmails, {
    ...e,
    from: "~redacted~",
  }]);
  return email({
    text: JSON.stringify(e),
    subject: "Emailed received at @stevekrouse.testEmail2!",
  });
}
```

The email address for [@user.testEmail](https://www.val.town/v/user.testEmail) is `user.testEmail@valtown.email`. Note that the username does not contain
a leading `@` and that the email domain is `valtown.email`.

You can view all the emails sent to your function with the followin val:

```ts val
import { blob } from "https://esm.town/v/std/blob";

const testEmails = await blob.getJSON("testEmails") as [];
console.log("Received emails:\n", testEmails ?? []);
```
