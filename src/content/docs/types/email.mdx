import Val from "@components/Val.astro";

Email handler vals get their own email address that you can send email
to, and when Val Town receives that email, it triggers the val with the email
as its first argument. Ever wanted a robot that you could forward emails to,
or to be able to control something via an email trigger? With email
handler vals it's simple: they get their own, unique address.

:::tip
Vals can send email, too! Using the [email function in the standard library](/std/email)
:::

## Type Signature

Email handlers receive an argument called `Email` and can do anything with it:
they can go on to reply to the email with the [standard library](/std/email),
or call methods in response to it.

```ts title="Example"
export function emailHandler(email: Email) {
  console.log("Email received!", email.from, email.subject, email.text);
}
```

The `Email` type has this shape:

```ts
interface Email {
  from: string;
  to: string[];
  subject: string | undefined;
  text: string | undefined;
  html: string | undefined;
}
```

## Example

**Save received emails**

<Val url="https://www.val.town/embed/maxm/emailExample" />

The email address for a val `@user.testEmail` would be `user.testEmail@valtown.email`. Note that the username does not contain
a leading `@` and that the email domain is `valtown.email`.

You can view all the emails sent to your function with the following val:

```ts title="List received emails" val
import { blob } from "https://esm.town/v/std/blob";

const testEmails = await blob.getJSON("testEmails") as [];
console.log("Received emails:\n", testEmails ?? []);
```
