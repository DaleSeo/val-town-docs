  You can use setTimeout in Val Town, but remember that vals are limited in how
  long they can run.

import Val from "@components/Val.astro";

You can use `setTimeout`, but it has some quirks:

1. We recommend that you wrap the timeout in a promise and await it. (Otherwise
   we may kill your evaluation prematurely if we fail to detect that it’s still
   waiting on a timeout.)

2. We don’t limit the duration of your timeout, but we do limit the duration of
   val execution (1 min for free accounts and 5 min for paid), so any timeout
   longer than this will not execute.
