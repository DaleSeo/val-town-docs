Val Town is a social website to write and deploy JavaScript. Create APIs, websites, scheduled functions, email yourself,
and persist data — all from the browser and instantly deployed.

- Vals are runnable JavaScript, TypeScript, and JSX modules
- Vals can import other vals, NPM, and more [↗](/reference/import)
- Vals can be public, unlisted, or private [↗](/reference/permissions)
- Vals are run via the Deno runtime

There are four different kinds of vals:

  - [**Script**](/types/script) - freeform, run manually, for one-off operations or testing
  - [**HTTP**](/types/http) - expose an API endpoint, make a website, or accept webhooks
  - [**Cron**](/types/cron) - trigger code on a timer or cron schedule
  - [**Email**](/types/email) - trigger code on an incoming email

**The Val Town Standard Library** provides a set of useful services:

  - [**Blob Storage**](/std/blob) - store and retrieve any data
  - [**SQLite**](/std/sqlite) - store and retrieve structured data
  - [**Email**](/std/email) - send emails

You can also use Val Town programmatically using the [Val Town SDK](/sdk).
