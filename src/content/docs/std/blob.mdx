lastUpdated: 2024-03-18

Val Town comes with blob storage built-in. It allows for storing any data: text, JSON, images. You can access it via [`std/blob`](https://www.val.town/v/std/blob).

Blob storage is scoped globally to your account. If you set a blob in one val, you can retrieve it by the same key in another val. It's backed by Cloudflare R2.

- Blob-stored data counts towards your total Val Town storage - 10mb on the free plan and 1gb on pro. Check our [pricing page](https://val.town/pricing) to learn more.
- Keys for blobs can be up to 512 characters long.

## Usage

```ts title="Example" val
import { blob } from "https://esm.town/v/std/blob";

await blob.setJSON("myKey", { foo: "bar" });
export let blobDemo = await blob.getJSON("myKey");
```

### JSON

These functions are the ones most commonly used for storing JSON data, including simple strings.

- `async getJSON(key: string)` - Retrieves a blob as JSON for a given key. Returns `undefined` if the key is not found.
- `async setJSON(key: string, value: any)` - Sets a blob for a given key with a value that is automatically converted to JSON.

### List keys

- `async list(prefix?: string)`: List your blob keys. optionally provide a prefix to filter the query.

### Copy key

- `async copy(previous: string, next: string)`: Copy a blob from one key to another.

### Move key

- `async move(previous: string, next: string)`: Move a blob from one key to another.

### Delete keys

- `async delete(key: string)`: Delete the specified key.

## Lower-level get/set

We do provide access to the lower-level getter and setters, which are useful if you are storing non-JSON or binary data, need to stream in your response or request data, or do anything else lower-level.

- `async get(key: string)`: Retrieves a blob for a given key.
- `async set(key: string, value: string | BodyInit)`: Sets the blob value for a given key. See [BodyInit](https://deno.land/api@v1.38.1?s=BodyInit).

## Error Handling

- `blob.get` can throw [`ValTownBlobNotFoundError`](https://val.town/v/std/ValTownBlobNotFoundError)
- Any method can throw [`ValTownBlobError`](https://val.town/v/andreterron/ValTownBlobError) for unexpected errors.
