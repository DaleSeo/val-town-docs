Val Town uses the [Deno](https://deno.com/) runtime.

- TypeScript and TSX are available for all vals, and at the time of this
  writing we support TypeScript 5.4.
- There is no filesystem access permitted.
- `--allow-net` is enabled, so they can make HTTP requests.
- Vals have access to [environment variables](/reference/environment-variables)
- The experimental [Temporal API](https://tc39.es/proposal-temporal/docs/) is
  enabled.

## Included environment

- `fetch` to make HTTP requests
- `import` from npm and https
- `setTimeout`
- `setInterval`

You can view the [custom types we support here](https://www.val.town/docs/types).
