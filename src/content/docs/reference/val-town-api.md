You can access individual vals [by giving them an HTTP endpoint](https://www.notion.so/HTTP-endpoint-7ba1119ebf5a433fb847528049909ec5?pvs=21), but thatâ€™s not all you can do with the Val Town API: we also provide endpoints that let you create and update vals, see likes and comments, and a lot more.
