There are three privacy settings for a Val:

| Permissions | Visible on the website    | Web & express endpoints |
| ----------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Public      | Yes                       | âœ…                      |
| Unlisted    | Only if you have the link | âœ…                      |
| Private     | No                        | Requires token          |

All Vals default to private. You can publish a Val by clicking the ðŸ”’ next to
its name.

You get to choose whether you share vals. They can be fully private, so only you
can view, edit, and run them. Private vals are super useful for automating parts of
your life or business. Or you can share vals publicly in the Val Town community,
and let anyone learn from your creativity and expand on your work.


## Exposing your vals to the internet

Public vals are great because they can be called from anywhere, anytime,
instantly.

Since anyone can call your public endpoints, if they interact with some data
that should only be changed by yourself, you will need to make sure that those
endpoints check for some kind of secret that only you know.

Here's an example of a val exposed using the [HTTP Val](/types/http), secured
with an environment variable that only I know.

```ts title="user/secretEndpoint" val
export const secretEndpoint = (req: Request) => {
  const secretHeader = req.headers.get("Authorization");
  
  if (secretHeader !== Deno.env.get("supersecrettoken")) {
    return new Response("Unauthorized", { status: 401 });
  }
  
  return new Response("My deepest darkest secret");
};
```

If I called it without supplying the environment variable, I'd be denied access:

```ts title="Without authentication" val
import { fetch } from "https://esm.town/v/std/fetch";

const response = await fetch("https://user-secretEndpoint.web.val.run");
console.log(response);
```

```js title="Logs"
Response {
  body: ReadableStream { locked: false },
  bodyUsed: false,
  headers: Headers { /* omitted */ },
  ok: false,
  redirected: false,
  status: 401,
  statusText: "Unauthorized",
  url: "http://localhost:3001/v1/fetch?url=https%3A%2F%2Fuser-secretEndpoint.web.val.run"
}
```

By supplying the environment variable in a header, I'm allowed access:

```ts title="With authentication" val
import { fetch } from "https://esm.town/v/std/fetch";

const response = await fetch(
  "https://user-secretEndpoint.web.val.run",
  { headers: { Authorization: "birdsarentreal" } },
);
console.log(response);
```

```js title="Logs"
Response {
  body: ReadableStream { locked: false },
  bodyUsed: false,
  headers: Headers { /* omitted */ },
  ok: true,
  redirected: false,
  status: 200,
  statusText: "OK",
  url: "http://localhost:3001/v1/fetch?url=https%3A%2F%2Fuser-secretEndpoint.web.val.run"
}
```

The rest of this article will focus on various common combinations of public and
private vals that you're likely to come across and how those interact with the
permissions system.

## Public code referencing private data

It is safe for a a public val to reference one of your private vals or one of
your environment variables. Private vals are like environment variables in this
way â€” others can see that they're being used, but not their values.

For example, I created a private val, `example3`. You won't be able to see or
reference `example3` but I can use it in `example4` which is public.

```ts title="@user/example4"
import { example3 } from "https://esm.town/v/user/example3";
console.log("Hi,", example3);
```

```txt title="Logs"
Hi, User
```

You can _infer_ that the value of `example3` is `"User"` because of
how it's used here. This is why you have to be careful about publishing vals
that reference private data. Typically you will reference private data in a way
that makes it impossible for others to infer what it is, like you would with an
environment variable credentials. Below I am passing my environment variables to an Upstash
Redis store. You can see that I'm using these environment variables and the output of this
computation, but you can't get those values, nor can you rerun this script with
my environment variables.

```ts title="Example" val
const { Redis } = await import("npm:@upstash/redis");
const redis = new Redis({
  url: Deno.env.get("upstashURL"),
  token: Deno.env.get("upstashToken"),
});
await redis.set("json-ex-1", { a: { b: "nested json" } });
return ((await redis.get("json-ex-1")) as any).a.b;
```

```ts title="Output"
nested json
```

## Using another's vals as a library

You can [import](/reference/import) any Public or Unlisted vals and use
them in your own code. In this way
it is safe to pass other's code your private data and environment variables.

```ts title="Example" val
import { gpt3 } from "https://esm.town/v/patrickjm/gpt3?v=4";

export let librarySecret = gpt3({
  prompt: "what is the meaning of life?",
  openAiKey: Deno.env.get("openai"),
});
```

If you're importing someone else's code, read the code first to make
sure it's trustworthy, and we recommend version-pinning any dependencies
against other people's code, like `?v=4` in the example above.
