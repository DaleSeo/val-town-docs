description: Vals can be private, unlisted, or public

import Val from "@components/Val.astro";

There are three privacy states for a Val:

1. ðŸŒŽ Public (anyone can view or run)
2. ðŸ”— Unlisted (anyone with the name or link can view or run)
3. ðŸ”’ Private (only you can view or run)

All Vals default to private. You can publish a Val by clicking the ðŸ”’ next to
its name.

Publishing your Val as either Public or Unlisted makes it accessible via the Run
API. Be careful about publishing a function val that has access to your environment variables
â€” your environment variables will be used if others call that function via the Run API.
Publishing a val makes it a public API.

You get to choose whether you share vals. They can be fully private, so only you
can view, edit, and run them. Private vals are super useful for automating parts of
your life or business. Or you can share vals publicly in the Val Town community,
and let anyone learn from your creativity and expand on your work.

| Permissions | Visible on the website    | Web & express endpoints          |
| ----------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Public      | Yes                       | Accessible                       |
| Unlisted    | Only if you have the link | Accessible                       |
| Private     | No                        | Requires token with each request |

## Exposing your vals to the internet

Public vals are great because they can be called from anywhere, anytime,
instantly. They can also be called _by anyone._

Since anyone can call your public endpoints, if they interact with some data
that should only be changed by yourself, you will need to make sure that those
endpoints check for some kind of secret that only you know.

Here's an example of a val exposed using the [HTTP Val](/types/http), secured
with an environment variable that only I know.

<Val url="https://www.val.town/embed/neverstew.secretEndpoint" />

If I called it without supplying the environment variable, I'll be denied access:

<Val url="https://www.val.town/embed/neverstew.secretEndpointFailure" />

By supplying the environment variable in a header, I'm allowed access:

<Val url="https://www.val.town/embed/neverstew.secretEndpointSuccess" />

The rest of this article will focus on various common combinations of public and
private vals that you're likely to come across and how those interact with the
permissions system.

## Public code referencing private data

It is safe for a a public val to reference one of your private vals or one of
your environment variables. Private vals are like environment variables in this
way â€” others can see that they're being used, but not their values.

For example, I created a private val, `example3`. You won't be able to see or
reference `example3` but I can use it in `example4` which is public.

<Val url="https://www.val.town/embed/stevekrouse.example4" />

You can _infer_ that the value of `example3` is `"Stevie"` because of
how it's used here. This is why you have to be careful about publishing vals
that reference private data. Typically you will reference private data in a way
that makes it impossible for others to infer what it is, like you would with an
environment variable credentials. Below I am passing my environment variables to an Upstash
Redis store. You can see that I'm using these environment variables and the output of this
computation, but you can't get those values, nor can you rerun this script with
my environment variables.

## Using another's vals as a library

Using another's val is like using a library from npm. The code runs entirely in
your sandbox and they don't get any access to your evaluation logs. In this way
it is safe to pass other's code your private data and environment variables.

```ts val
import process from "node:process";
import { gpt3 } from "https://esm.town/v/patrickjm/gpt3?v=4";

export let librarySecret = gpt3({
  prompt: "what is the meaning of life?",
  openAiKey: process.env.openai,
});
```
