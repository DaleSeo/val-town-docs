Townie is an AI assistant that can help you create and edit vals in Val Town.
You can use Townie to create backend services, websites, and other vals
that are deployed instantly to quickly iterate on an idea.

## Get started

To create a new val based on your own prompts,
navigate to [Townie](https://val.town/townie), type in a prompt, and hit submit.
Once Townie has created a val, you'll see a preview of the live code.
You can continue the conversation to iterate on your val further or open the **_Code_** tab
to make manual edits if needed.

## Edit an existing val

To start a conversation with Townie based on an existing HTTP val, go to the val's detail page and click the **_Edit with Townie_** link.
Note that Townie currently only edit HTTP vals.

You can also start a new chat thread based on an existing val by clicking **_Edit an existing val_** in the Townie sidebar, then searching for the val you would like to edit.

## Start a new chat

To start a new chat about the current val, click the dropdown above the conversation and click **_Start a new chat_**.

## Delete a chat thread

To delete a chat thread, click the dropdown above the conversation and click **_Delete chat_**.

## Tips for effective prompting

1. **Be Specific:** Provide detailed instructions for your desired val.
1. **Offer Context:** Explain the purpose of your val or any specific requirements.
1. **Request Explanations:** Ask Townie to clarify or elaborate on the generated code.
1. **Iterate:** Refine your requests based on initial results to improve the output.
1. **Consider Alternatives:** Ask Townie to suggest different approaches or implementations.

Sometimes Townie can make mistakes.
If we are able to catch the error, a button to **_Fix the code_** will appear above the prompt.
In other cases, mistakes can usually be recovered from by using specific prompts.

- If Townie generates only partial code or a diff patch fails, try replying with a phrase like _"Respond with the full code"_.
- If you prefer that Townie respond to a small change with only a diff to speed up the code generation, you can say _"Respond with a valid unified diff only"_

## Advanced

Townie uses a custom system prompt to generate code that is appropriate for Val Town.
If you'd like to adjust the prompt for a specific use-case, open the Townie settings by clicking the cog icon, edit the prompt and hit **_Save_**.
