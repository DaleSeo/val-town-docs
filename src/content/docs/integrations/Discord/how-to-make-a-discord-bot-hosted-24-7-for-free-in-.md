## Introduction

By the end of this tutorial you will have a Discord bot hosted 24/7, for free,
forever, on [Val Town](http://val.town), that responds to a basic `/ping`
[Slash Command](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500000368501-Slash-Commands-FAQ).

[Val Town](http://val.town) is a social website to write, and deploy JavaScript
from the browser.

No prior coding experience required. The vast majority of this tutorial is
creating the bot on Discord and pasting your keys into Val Town. The actual
coding parts are just clicking ******Run****** two times to fork over two pieces
of code to your Val Town account.
