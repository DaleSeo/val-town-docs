import Val from "@components/Val.astro";

Airtable is a spreadsheet-database hybrid. Note that because
[val.town](http://val.town) uses Deno, we use an unofficial library.

## Setup

On the homepage, click Start from scratch to create a base:

![Untitled](./airtable/untitled.png)

If prompted with automatic setup, click Skip. You should get a new base with a
blank table.

![Untitled](./airtable/untitled-1.png)

Adjust the table fields as you want (note that this isn’t covered by this
guide).

Click on your profile icon, then on Developer hub:

![Untitled](./airtable/untitled-2.png)

Click Create new token.

![Untitled](./airtable/untitled-3.png)

Fill out the fields:

- Name: Any. For example, `valtown`.
- Scopes: You’ll most likely want to add `data.records:read` and
  `data.records:write`.
- Access: Add the base you created earlier.

Lastly, click Create token. Here’s an example of how your settings could
probably look like:

![Untitled](./airtable/untitled-4.png)

Copy your token and click Done.

![Untitled](./airtable/untitled-5.png)

Go to [val.town](http://val.town), click on your username and then on Secrets:

![Untitled](./airtable/untitled-6.png)

Click New secret. Set the key to a name you want to use to reference the token
(for example, `airtable_pat`) and paste the copied personal access token into
the value, then click Add.

You can then use Airtable from [val.town](http://val.town) like so:

<Val url="https://www.val.town/embed/mattx.airtable_deno_sample" />

Make sure to change:

- apiKey if you have used a different name for your secret.
- baseId to the ID of your base. You can find it in the URL bar while a table is
  open and it will likely start with `app`:

![Untitled](./airtable/untitled-8.png)

- tableName to either the name of your table or the table ID which can also be
  found in the URL after the base ID (see above).
