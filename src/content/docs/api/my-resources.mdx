import Val from "@components/Val.astro";

When using the Val Town API, some of the most common functions operate on things
that you own. For these kinds of operations, there are the “me” routes.

## GET `/v1/me`

:::note

This is the same as `/v1/users/{your_user_id}`

:::

<Val url="https://www.val.town/embed/neverstew.getMe" />

## GET `/v1/me/runs`

:::note

This is currently the only way to list runs across multiple vals.
