## Get val code

```
GET https://esm.town/v/{username}/{val_name}
```

This is the endpoint for val source code: it's what Val Town itself
uses internally when you run vals. For example, the `std/set` val
is available on esm.town at https://esm.town/v/std/set?v=15

- This endpoint will always redirect to a specific version (`?v=15`)
  if a version isn't provided initially.
- We detect your client - whether it's a browser, Deno, or something
  else, and try to serve raw TypeScript source code when the client
  is able to parse it, and transpiled JavaScript when it can't.
  This includes [JSX syntax](/types/http/jsx/).
  See [our guide on interoperability](/guides/interop/) for more
  information on using vals in other systems.
- Private vals are accessible on esm.town only by providing a
  [Bearer token](/api/authentication).
