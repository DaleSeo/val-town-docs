You can access individual vals
[by giving them an HTTP endpoint](/types/http),
but that's not all you can do with the Val Town API: we also provide endpoints
that let you create and update vals, see likes and comments, and a lot more.

## OpenAPI Spec

The v1 API is defined via an
[OpenAPI spec](https://api.val.town/openapi.json) and the docs for it are
[hosted here](https://api.val.town/documentation).
