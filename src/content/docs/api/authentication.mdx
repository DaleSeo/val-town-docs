The Val Town APIs accept Bearer Token authentication for full access to your Val
Town account. You can use the schemes below to give more scoped access to run
specific vals.

## Val Town Authentication

Keep your Val Town API token extremely guarded because it conveys access to your
entire account and all of its environment variables. Never expose this token on the client.

Val Town's API uses Bearer Authentication, which means you pass an HTTP Header
`Authorization: Bearer <token>`.

If you don't pass an authentication token, your code will be run as an anonymous
user and only have access to public vals. For example, unauthenticated access to
a private val will fail:

```ts title="Unauthenticated example" val
import { fetch } from "https://esm.town/v/std/fetch";

export const privateAPIUnauthenticated = (
  await fetch("https://api.val.town/v1/run/stevekrouse.example3")
).status;
```

Authenticated use will have read access to the authenticated user's private vals
and environment variables, write access to the authenticated user's vals, and the ability to
send the authenticated user emails via [`std/email`](/std/email).

```ts title="Authenticated example" val
import { fetchJSON } from "https://esm.town/v/stevekrouse/fetchJSON";

export const privateAPIAuthenticated = fetchJSON(
  "https://api.val.town/v1/run/stevekrouse.example3",
  {
    method: "GET",
    headers: { Authorization: "Bearer " + Deno.env.get("valtown") },
  }
);
```

You can access your
[Val Town API tokens here](https://www.val.town/settings/api).

If you want to experiment with calling the Val Town API from within Val Town (as
is shown above), you should copy-and-paste one of your Val Town API tokens into
[your environment variables](https://www.val.town/settings/environment-variables).

## API Token Lifecycles

API Tokens come with configurable expiration dates. We strongly recommend
setting expiration dates for your tokens and rotating them regularly.

If you accidentally leak or misplace an API token, you can delete it [on the API
Tokens paage](https://www.val.town/settings/api), immediately preventing any
further access to your account.

In rare cases where we detect a potential leak of your API Token, we'll take
proactive measures. We'll automatically revoke the compromised token and
promptly notify you via email.

## Custom Authentication

You can roll arbitrary authentication schemes in user space. For example, I find
it useful to simply supply a custom `auth` header from my Clerk webhooks that I
check like a password against a value I store in my environment variables:

```ts title="Clerk example" val
import { discordWebhook } from "https://esm.town/v/stevekrouse/discordWebhook";

// # New Val Town User (on Clerk) -> Val Town Discord notification
// Translates one kind of webhook (Clerk) into another (Discord)
export async function handleDiscordNewUser(req: express.Request, res) {
  // check custom auth secret sent from clerk
  if (req.get("auth") !== process.env.clerkNonSensitive)
    return res.end("Unauthorized");
  await discordWebhook({
    url: Deno.env.get("discordUserEvents"),
    content:
      req.body.data.email_addresses[0].email_address +
      " " +
      req.body.data.profile_image_url,
  });
  res.end("Success");
}
```

I call this value `clerkNonSensitive` because this value doesn't protect any
data. It merely makes it impossible for anyone to trigger this public API
endpoint without the password. The worst that could happen if this password
leaks is that our team temporarily gets spam discord messages. Then I could just
change the password to a new value. For more sensitive use-cases, you'll want to
sign & possibly encrypt the conveyed data using standard authentication methods.

## Hiding Code

You can hide the code of a public API by wrapping a private Val in a public val.
Below I show `hiddenAPI` which you can see and
[call via API](https://api.val.town/v1/run/stevekrouse.hiddenAPI?args=[%22hi%22]),
but you notice that it calls `@stevekrouse.hiddenAPIInternal` which is private
and can't be inspected.

```ts title="Hiding code example" val
import { hiddenAPIInternal } from "https://esm.town/v/stevekrouse/hiddenAPIInternal";

export let hiddenAPI = (...args) => hiddenAPIInternal(...args);
```
