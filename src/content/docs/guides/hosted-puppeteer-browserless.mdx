Some websites are partially (or entirely) rendered on the client (aka your web
browser). If you try to search the initial HTML for elements that haven’t
finished rendering, you won’t find them.

One solution is to use a headless browser that runs a web browser in the
background that fetches the page, renders it, and _then_ allows you to search
the final document.

Headless browsers aren’t a good fit for Val Town due to the amount of resources
they require to run. However, services like [Browserless](https://browserless.io/)
provide APIs to interact with a hosted headless browser. For example, their
[/scrape API](https://www.browserless.io/docs/scrape). Here's how to use
Browserless and Val Town to load a webpage.

## Sign up to Browserless and grab your API Key

Copy your API Key from
[https://cloud.browserless.io/account/](https://cloud.browserless.io/account/)
and save it as a Val Town secret as `browserlessKey`.

## Make an API call to the [/scrape API](https://www.browserless.io/docs/scrape)

Check the documentation for the
[/scrape API](https://www.browserless.io/docs/scrape) and form your request.

For example, here’s how you scrape the introduction paragraph of OpenAI’s
wikipedia page.

Browserless also has more [APIs](https://www.browserless.io/docs/start) for
taking screenshots and PDFs of websites.

## Alternatively, use Puppeteer and a browser running on Browserless

You can use the [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/) library to connect to a browser
instance running on Browserless.

Once you’ve navigated to a page, you can run arbitrary JavaScript with
`page.evaluate` – like getting the text from a paragraph.
