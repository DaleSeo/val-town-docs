You can submit forms to Val Town using the [HTTP Val](/types/http) . You can
place these forms on any page on the internet - or host the form directly on Val
Town.

These examples show how to accept and store email addresses on Val Town. The
email addresses are saved into a val, and you also get sent an email
notification for each new signup.

## Add a form to your website

### Create a val that uses the [HTTP Val](/types/http)

Write a val function that accepts a
[Request](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/web/api/request) and returns
a [Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/web/api/response), or just
fork the one below!

```ts title="@user/saveFormData" val
import { blob } from "https://esm.town/v/std/blob?v=11";
import { email } from "https://esm.town/v/std/email?v=11";

export const saveFormData = async (req: Request) => {
  // Get existing list of submitted email addresses
  let submittedEmailAddresses = await blob.getJSON("submittedEmailAddresses") as string[];

  // If there were no email addresses stored, create an empty array
  submittedEmailAddresses ??= [];

  // Pick out the form data
  const formData = await req.formData();
  const emailAddress = formData.get("email") as string;
  if (submittedEmailAddresses.includes(emailAddress)) {
    return new Response("You're already signed up!");
  }

  // Send a notification email
  email({ text: `${emailAddress} just signed up!`, subject: "New sign up" });

  // Store form data
  submittedEmailAddresses.push(emailAddress);
  await blob.setJSON("submittedEmailAddresses", submittedEmailAddresses);

  return new Response("Thanks! You're signed up!");
};
```

### Add the form to your webpage

Copy your val's Web endpoint URL using the menu (Endpoints > Copy web endpoint)
and set it as the form's action (this tells the form where to send its data when
it's submitted).

Below is a full HTML page example. If you are adding a form to an existing page
just copy and paste the `<form></form>` block.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Email Form</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Change the action here to your val's Express endpoint! -->
    <form action="https://user-saveFormData.web.val.run" method="post">
      <label for="email">Email:</label>
      <input type="email" id="email" name="email" required />
      <br />
      <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
    </form>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Host your form on Val Town

There are two ways to do this. You can write a val function that serves a
webpage, and a separate val that accepts the form data - or you can write a
single val that does both like the example below.

When a form is submitted, it sends a HTTP request with the
[POST](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/POST) method.
When a user visits a webpage in their web browser, the server (your val
function) gets sent a
[GET](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/GET) request.

You can check the HTTP method using `req.method` and change how your val
function responds.

```ts title="@user/renderFormAndSaveData" ins={5-27} val
import { blob } from "https://esm.town/v/std/blob?v=11";
import { email } from "https://esm.town/v/std/email?v=11";

export const renderFormAndSaveData = async (req: Request) => {
  // A visit from a web browser? Serve a HTML page with a form
  if (req.method === "GET") {
    return new Response(
      `
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Email Form</title>
</head>
<body>
  <!-- Change the action here to THIS val's Express endpoint! -->
  <form action="https://user-renderFormAndSaveData.web.val.run" method="post">
    <label for="email">Email:</label>
    <input type="email" id="email" name="email" required>
    <br>
    <input type="submit" value="Submit">
  </form>
</body>
</html>
    `,
      { headers: { "Content-Type": "text/html" } },
    );
  }

  // Get existing list of submitted email addresses
  let submittedEmailAddresses = await blob.getJSON("submittedEmailAddresses") as string[];

  // If there were no email addresses stored, create an empty array
  submittedEmailAddresses ??= [];

  // Pick out the form data
  const formData = await req.formData();
  const emailAddress = formData.get("email") as string;
  if (submittedEmailAddresses.includes(emailAddress)) {
    return new Response("You're already signed up!");
  }
  email({ text: `${emailAddress} just signed up!`, subject: "New sign up" });
  // Store form data
  submittedEmailAddresses.push(emailAddress);
  await blob.setJSON("submittedEmailAddresses", submittedEmailAddresses);

  return new Response("Thanks! You're signed up!");
};
```

See [Web forms â€” Working with user data](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms)
on the MDN Web Docs site for more help with forms. Forms are a basic part of
the web - you don't need a lot of front-end JavaScript to make them work.
